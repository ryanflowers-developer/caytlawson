            “Nothing has changed.” His words were direct and curt.<br/><br/>

            Ann stiffened, feeling her anger with him return, “I hadn’t been under the impression they had.”<br/><br/>

            “Do not confront me again on the matter. I will not change my mind. No woman or child allowed on the trail unless accompanied by a guardian. Is that understood?”<br/><br/>

            “Perfectly.” She leveled him with her most imperious stare. Then added impertinently, “And do you own the trail, then?”<br/><br/>

            His jaw clenched in irritable fashion, fastening her with a menacing glower, “Don’t even think about following on your own.”<br/><br/>

            “You can’t stop me.”<br/><br/>
